                <h2>BST-Based Dictionary - Learning Experiment</h2>
                <h4>Objective:</h4>
                <p>To explore how a Binary Search Tree can be used to implement a simple dictionary and to understand its behavior in comparison with Trie-based approaches.</p>
                <h4>Approach:</h4>
                <p>Implemented a small dictionary with a limited set of words and meanings using a Binary Search Tree. Although Trie is the standard structure for dictionaries, BST was intentionally chosen to experiment with alternative data structure usage and internal operations.</p>
                <h4>Key Learnings:</h4>
                <ul>
                    <li>Binary Search Trees can be used for basic dictionary lookups but are not optimal for prefix-based searches</li>
                    <li>Trie structures are better suited for large-scale dictionary implementations</li>
                    <li>Data structure selection should be based on problem requirements rather than conventions</li>

                <h2>Flutter Calculator App - Learning Project</h2>
                <h4>Objective:</h4>
                <p>To understand the fundamentals of Flutter application development by building a simple calculator that performs basic arithmetic operations.</p>
                <h4>Approach:</h4>
                <p>Developed a calculator application using Flutter during the learning phase. The app supports basic operations such as addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division, focusing on UI layout, state management, and user interaction handling.</p>
                <h4>Key Learnings:</h4>
                <ul>
                    <li>Gained hands-on experience with Flutter widgets and layout structure</li>
                    <li>Learned to manage user input and update UI dynamically</li>
                    <li>Understood basic application logic and event handling in Flutter</li>
                </ul>

                <h2>Banking Application using Tkinter - Learning Project</h2>
                <h4>Objective:</h4>
                <p>To understand the basics of application development and user interaction by building a simple banking application using Python's Tkinter library.</p>
                <h4>Approach:</h4>
                <p>Developed a basic desktop banking application using Tkinter during the initial learning phase. The app allows users to create an account with a username and PIN, log in using those credentials, and perform simulated banking operations such as deposit, withdrawal, and balance checking. No database was used, as the focus was on application logic and UI flow.</p>
                <h4>Key Learnings:</h4>
                <ul>
                    <li>Gained early experience in building GUI-based applications</li>
                    <li>Understood event handling and control flow in desktop applications</li>
                    <li>Learned how application logic works before integrating databases</li>
                    <li>Built a strong foundation that later helped transition smoothly to Flutter</li>
                </ul>
