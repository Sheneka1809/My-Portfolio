                    <h3>Who I Am</h3>
                    <p>
                        I'm Sheneka K, currently pursuing my B.Tech in Information Technology at New Prince Shri Bhavani College of Engineering and Technology, in my final semester and actively stepping into my professional career.

                    <h3>My Mindset</h3>
                    <p>
                        I'm deeply interested in solving problems and researching them thoroughly before jumping into solutions. I approach every problem through both technical reasoning and out-of-the-box thinking, exploring multiple paths to arrive at the most effective outcome.

                    <h3>How I Work</h3>
                    <p>
                        Being from an IT background, I try to build solutions on my own whenever possible. In this AI-driven era, I use AI tools as assistants, not decision-makers. I believe that when AI is guided properly, it can help save time and improve efficiency — but the responsibility of thinking and validating always lies with the developer.

                    <h3>What I'm Building Towards</h3>
                    <p>
                        I focus on learning by building real solutions to real problems, improving my skills step by step while preparing myself for industry-level challenges.
