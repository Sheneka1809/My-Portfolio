                <h4>The Problem:</h4>
                <p>
                    Students often receive college symposium and event posters after registration deadlines or event dates have already passed, leading to missed opportunities and confusion.

                <p>
                    Built a centralized mobile platform where educational event and symposium information can be shared in real time, ensuring students receive accurate and timely updates without delays.

                <p>Managing travel duty schedules manually often leads to confusion, missed updates, and difficulty in tracking ongoing and completed duties, especially when handling multiple customers and dates.</p>
                <h4>The Solution:</h4>
                <p>Developed a mobile application that digitally organizes travel duty details, separates ongoing and completed duties, highlights priority schedules, and allows quick sharing of information with customers.</p>
                <h4>Key Features:</h4>
                <ul>
                    <li>Ongoing and Finished duty tabs for clear task separation</li>
                    <li>Priority highlighting for today's and tomorrow's duties</li>
                    <li>Date-based sorting in descending order for quick access</li>
                    <li>Edit, delete, and search functionality for duty records</li>
                    <li>Duty sharing feature for customer communication</li>
                    <li>Secure Gmail-based user authentication</li>
                </ul>
                <h4>Tech Used:</h4>
                <p>Flutter (Dart), Firebase Authentication, Firebase Firestore, Firebase Remote Config</p>
                <h4>My Contribution:</h4>
                <p>Designed and developed the complete application independently, implemented Firebase services, and applied priority-based logic and sorting to improve usability and efficiency.</p>
